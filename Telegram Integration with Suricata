##Telegram Integration with Suricata 

Requirements:
• Telegram Bot Token
• Chat ID (group or user)

Creating the bot
1. To send Wazuh alerts to a Telegram chat, we need to create a bot first. To do this
we have to send a couple of messages to @BotFather. After starting the bot with
the /start command, we have to send the /newbot command to start creating the
bot, and we will choose the name of the bot, Suricata_bot

2. Next lets created the new bots to get alert messages suricata bot name
